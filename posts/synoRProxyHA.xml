    Synology NAS is the perfect companion to running Home Assistant. 
    But by default, the DSM Reverse Proxy does not configure its NGINX settings to allow WebSocket, 
    and some extra configuration will be required to get the Home Assistant frontend working with the DSM.
    Setup headers
    Starting with DSM 6.2.1+, you can create “custom headers” in the Application Portal:

    Go to Application Portal and edit your entry
    Click on “custom headers” tab and click the dropdown on the “Create” button
    Select “Websocket”. This will automatically add the required headers for WebSocket to this reverse proxy.
    Click “OK”. Home Assistant should work now with the reverse proxy.
